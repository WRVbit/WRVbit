## 🚀 About Us

Welcome to **WRVbit**. We are a forward-thinking development organization dedicated to building the next generation of Linux applications. Our mission is to combine the **raw performance and safety of Rust** with the **modern, reactive UI capabilities of Svelte**, delivered through the lightweight **Tauri** framework.

We believe that native desktop applications should be beautiful, fast, and resource-efficient. We are strictly moving away from heavy Electron-based apps to providing purely native-feeling experiences that respect your hardware.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

We leverage cutting-edge technologies to deliver the best user experience:

- **Core Logic:** [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) 🦀 - For memory safety, concurrency, and blazing speed.
- **Frontend Framework:** [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) 🧡 - For truly reactive, compiler-optimized user interfaces.
- **Application Runtime:** [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) 🌟 - For secure, tiny, and fast native application bundles.
- **Type Safety:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) 📘 - For robust and maintainable codebase.

**Status:** `Active Dev` | **Stack:** Rust, Iced
A modern, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator built for speed and beauty. Designed to be the fastest and most customizable terminal on the Linux desktop.

#### [Glance](https://github.com/WRVbit/glance) 🌍
**Status:** `Public` | **Stack:** Rust, Tauri
A quick-preview utility for files, allowing you to peek at file contents without opening them fully.

### 🔵 Long-Term Vision
- **Nova Desktop Environment (DE)**: Our ultimate goal is to architect a complete, Rust-based Desktop Environment. A DE that is not only visually breathtaking but also rock-solid, secure, and incredibly responsive. Imagine a desktop where every component, from the compositor to the shell, is written in Rust.

## 🤝 Philosophy

1.  **Performance First:** No compromises on speed. If it's slow, it's a bug.
2.  **Visual Excellence:** Linux apps shouldn't look like they're from the 90s. We strive for pixel-perfect, modern designs.
3.  **Open & Transparent:** All our code is open-source. We build with the community, for the community.
